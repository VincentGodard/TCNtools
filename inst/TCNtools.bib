	abstract = {For the last two decades, in situ produced cosmogenic nuclides are increasingly applied in Earth sciences to quantify surface processes. In parallel, significant reduction of the analytical uncertainties linked to advances in accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) allows more precise measurements. However, among all the published works on cosmogenic nuclides, only few studies are dedicated to a better understanding of their production systematic or to a better constrain of the physical parameters involved in their production. Thus, an approach to investigate in situ produced cosmogenic nuclides 10Be, 26Al and 36Cl along a single 11-meter long core drilled from the surface and composed of carbonates and quartzose conglomerates has been launched. These measurements have been used to quantify muon-induced productions based on natural samples for each studied nuclide. Contrary to the current most oftenly used calculation of muon-induced production parameters which are based on irradiation experiments at discrete energies, productions based on natural samples are considering the entire energy range of particles reaching the ground surface. The evolution of 36Cl concentrations with depth needs to agree with those parameters deduced from 10Be and 26Al data. This is optimized when considering a fast muon-induced 36Cl production contribution and a spallation production rate at Sea Level High Latitude (SLHL) of (42.0 ± 2.0) atoms 36Cl·g·Ca− 1·a− 1 (1 sigma uncertainty).},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, in situ-produced cosmogenic nuclides have revolutionised the study of landscape evolution. In particular, numerous studies have demonstrated that, in active tectonic settings, cosmicrayexposure dating of deformed or displaced geomorphic features makes it possible to quantify long-term deformation rates. In western European countries, erosion due to climatically driven processes and human activities is probably the factor that most limits the accuracy of exposure ages and landscape modification rates. In this study, we present the results of a depth-profiling technique applied to alluvial terraces located along the Rhône and the Moyenne Durance rivers. The expected decrease with depth of the measured 10Be concentrations has been modelled using a χ2 inversion method in order to constrain the exposure history of the alluvial sediments. The results suggest that: (1) over the Quaternary, the local surface erosionrates including both regional uplift and climatically driven processes acting on landforms are on the order of 30 m/Myr in southeastern France, and (2) providing a fairly good bracketing of the exposure age, the modelled abandonment age of alluvial terraces affected by the Moyenne Durance Fault allows estimating incision rates, comparing the alluvial terrace elevations with topographic river profiles, and a minimum vertical slip rate value of roughly 0.02 mm/yr for the southern segment of the Moyenne Durance Fault.},

	abstract = {The cosmic ray flux increases at higher altitude as air pressure and the shielding effect of the atmosphere decrease. Altitude-dependent scaling factors are required to compensate for this effect in calculating cosmic ray exposure ages. Scaling factors in current use assume a uniform relationship between altitude and atmospheric pressure over the Earth's surface. This masks regional differences in mean annual pressure and spatial variation in cosmogenic isotope production rates. Outside Antarctica, air pressures over land depart from the standard atmosphere by ±4.4 hPa (1σ) near sea level, corresponding to offsets of ±3–4\% in isotope production rates. Greater offsets occur in regions of persistent high and low pressure such as Siberia and Iceland, where conventional scaling factors predict production rates in error by ±10\%. The largest deviations occur over Antarctica where ground level pressures are 20–40 hPa lower than the standard atmosphere at all altitudes. Isotope production rates in Antarctica are therefore 25–30\% higher than values calculated by scaling Northern Hemisphere production rates with conventional scaling factors. Exposure ages of old Antarctic surfaces, especially those based on cosmogenic radionuclides at levels close to saturation, may be millions of years younger than published estimates.},

	abstract = {The cosmogenic nuclide exposure history method is undergoing major developments in analytical, theoretical, and applied areas. The capability to routinely measure low concentrations of stable and radioactive cosmogenic nuclides has led to new methods for addressing long-standing geologic questions and has provided insights into rates and styles of surficial processes. The different physical and chemical properties of the six most widely used nuclides: 3He, 10Be, 14C, 21Ne, 26Al, and 36Cl, make it possible to apply the surface exposure dating methods on rock surfaces of virtually any lithology at any latitude and altitude, for exposures ranging from 102 to 107 years. The terrestrial in situ cosmogenic nuclide method is beginning to revolutionize the manner in which we study landscape evolution. Single or multiple nuclides can be measured in a single rock surface to obtain erosion rates on boulder and bedrock surfaces, fluvial incision rates, denudation rates of individual landforms or entire drainage basins, burial histories of rock surfaces and sediment, scarp retreat, fault slip rates, paleoseismology, and paleoaltimetry. Ages of climatic variations recorded by moraine and alluvium sediments are being directly determined. Advances in our understanding of how cosmic radiation interacts with the geomagnetic field and atmosphere will improve numerical simulations of cosmic-ray interactions over any exposure duration and complement additional empirical measurements of nuclide production rates. The total uncertainty in the exposure ages is continually improving. This article presents the theory necessary for interpreting cosmogenic nuclide data, reviews estimates of parameters, describes strategies and practical considerations in field applications, and assesses sources of error in interpreting cosmogenic nuclide measurements.

	abstract = {Terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides, produced by secondary cosmic-ray interactions in the atmosphere and in situ within minerals in the shallow lithosphere, are widely used to date surface exposure of rocks and sediments, to estimate erosion and weathering rates, and to date sediment deposition or burial. Their use has transformed geomorphology and Quaternary geology, for the first time allowing landforms to be dated and denudation rates to be measured over soil-forming time scales. The application of cosmogenic nuclides to geology began soon after the invention of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) in 1977 and increased dramatically with the measurement of in situ-produced nuclides in mineral grains near Earth's surface in the 1980s. The past 25 yr have witnessed the development of cosmogenic nuclides from their initial detection to their prevalence today as a standard geochronological and geochemical tool. This review covers the major developments of the past 25 yr by comparing the state of the field in 1988 with that of today, and by identifying key advances in that period that moved the field forward. We emphasize the most commonly used in situ-produced nuclides measured by AMS for geological applications, but we also discuss other nuclides where their applications overlap. Our review covers AMS instrumentation, cosmogenic nuclide production rates, the methods of surface exposure dating, measurement of erosion and weathering, and burial dating, and meteoric 10Be. --In memoriam: Devendra Lal (1929-2012), whose vision inspired the field.},

	abstract = {Several models have been proposed for scaling in situ cosmogenic nuclide production rates from the relatively few sites where they have been measured to other sites of interest. Two main types of models are recognized: (1) those based on data from nuclear disintegrations in photographic emulsions combined with various neutron detectors, and (2) those based largely on neutron monitor data. However, stubborn discrepancies between these model types have led to frequent confusion when calculating surface exposure ages from production rates derived from the models. To help resolve these discrepancies and identify the sources of potential biases in each model, we have developed a new scaling model based on analytical approximations to modeled fluxes of the main atmospheric cosmic-ray particles responsible for in situ cosmogenic nuclide production. Both the analytical formulations and the Monte Carlo model fluxes on which they are based agree well with measured atmospheric fluxes of neutrons, protons, and muons, indicating they can serve as a robust estimate of the atmospheric cosmic-ray flux based on first principles. We are also using updated records for quantifying temporal and spatial variability in geomagnetic and solar modulation effects on the fluxes. A key advantage of this new model (herein termed LSD) over previous Monte Carlo models of cosmogenic nuclide production is that it allows for faster estimation of scaling factors based on time-varying geomagnetic and solar inputs. Comparing scaling predictions derived from the LSD model with those of previously published models suggest potential sources of bias in the latter can be largely attributed to two factors: different energy responses of the secondary neutron detectors used in developing the models, and different geomagnetic parameterizations.Given that the LSD model generates flux spectra for each cosmic-ray particle of interest, it is also relatively straightforward to generate nuclide-specific scaling factors based on recently updated neutron and proton excitation functions (probability of nuclide production in a given nuclear reaction as a function of energy) for commonly measured in situ cosmogenic nuclides. Such scaling factors reflect the influence of the energy distribution of the flux folded with the relevant excitation functions. Resulting scaling factors indicate 3He shows the strongest positive deviation from the flux-based scaling, while 14C exhibits a negative deviation. These results are consistent with a recent Monte Carlo-based study using a different cosmic-ray physics code package but the same excitation functions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We report a new program for calculating catchment-averaged denudation rates from cosmogenic radionuclide concentrations. The method (Catchment-Averaged denudatIon Rates from cosmogenic Nuclides: CAIRN) bundles previously reported production scaling and topographic shielding algorithms. In addition, it calculates production and shielding on a pixel-by-pixel basis. We explore the sampling frequency across both azimuth (\&Delta;\textit{\&theta;}) and altitude (\&Delta;\textit{\&phi;}) angles for topographic shielding and show that in high relief terrain a relatively high sampling frequency is required, with a good balance achieved between accuracy and computational expense at \&Delta;\textit{\&theta;} = 8\&deg; and \&Delta;\textit{\&phi;} = 5\&deg;. The method includes both internal and external uncertainty analysis, and is packaged in freely available software in order to facilitate easily reproducible denudation rate estimates. CAIRN calculates denudation rates but also automates catchment averaging of shielding and production, and thus can be used to provide reproducible input parameters for the CRONUS family of online calculators.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In practice, this production rate parameter is set by calibration of the model using cosmogenic nuclide data from sites with independent age constraints. In this paper, we describe a calibration procedure developed during the Cosmic-Ray Produced Nuclide Systematics on Earth (CRONUS-Earth) project and its application to an extensive data set that included both new CRONUS-Earth samples and samples from previously published studies. We considered seven frameworks for elevation and latitude scaling and five commonly used cosmogenic nuclides, 3He, 10Be, 14C, 26Al, and 36Cl. In general, the results show that the calibrated production rates fail statistical tests of goodness-of-fit. One conclusion from the calibration results is that two newly developed scaling frameworks and the widely used Lal scaling framework provide qualitatively similar fits to the data, while neutron-monitor based scaling frameworks have much poorer fit to the data. To further test the fitted models, we computed site ages for a number of secondary sites not included in the primary calibration data set. The root-mean-square percent differences between the median computed ages for these secondary sites and independent ages range from 7.1\% to 27.1\%, differences that are much larger than the typical uncertainties in the site ages. The results indicate that there are substantial unresolved difficulties in modeling cosmogenic nuclide production and the calibration of production rates.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The rate at which low-lying sandy areas in temperate regions, such as the Campine Plateau (NE Belgium), have been eroding during the Quaternary is a matter of debate. Current knowledge on the average pace of landscape evolution in the Campine area is largely based on geological inferences and modern analogies. We performed a Bayesian inversion of an in situ-produced 10Be concentration depth profile to infer the average long-term erosion rate together with two other parameters: the surface exposure age and the inherited 10Be concentration. Compared to the latest advances in probabilistic inversion of cosmogenic radionuclide (CRN) data, our approach has the following two innovative components: it (1) uses Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and (2) accounts (under certain assumptions) for the contribution of model errors to posterior uncertainty. To investigate to what extent our approach differs from the state of the art in practice, a comparison against the Bayesian inversion method implemented in the CRONUScalc program is made. Both approaches identify similar maximum a posteriori (MAP) parameter values, but posterior parameter and predictive uncertainty derived using the method taken in CRONUScalc is moderately underestimated. A simple way for producing more consistent uncertainty estimates with the CRONUScalc-like method in the presence of model errors is therefore suggested. Our inferred erosion rate of 39 ± 8. 9 mm kyr−1 (1σ) is relatively large in comparison with landforms that erode under comparable (paleo-)climates elsewhere in the world. We evaluate this value in the light of the erodibility of the substrate and sudden base level lowering during the Middle Pleistocene. A denser sampling scheme of a two-nuclide concentration depth profile would allow for better inferred erosion rate resolution, and including more uncertain parameters in the MCMC inversion.},

	abstract = {Geological surface-exposure dating using cosmogenic-nuclide accumulation became a practical geochronological endeavor in 1986, when the utility of 10Be, 26Al, 36Cl, and 3He were all demonstrated. In response to the lack of a common basis for quantifying analytical consistency and calibrating cosmogenic-nuclide production, the CRONUS-Earth Project in the U.S. was started in 2005, along with a European partner project, CRONUS-EU. The goal of the CRONUS-Earth Project was to improve the accuracy and precision of terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide dating in general, focusing especially on nuclide production rates and their variation with altitude, latitude, and time, and to attempt to move from empirically based methods to ones with a stronger basis in physics. The CRONUS-Earth Project conducted extensive intercomparisons of reference materials to attempt to quantify analytical reproducibility at the community level. We found that stated analytical uncertainties nearly always underestimate the actual degree of variability, as quantified by the over-all coefficient of variation of the intercalibration data. The average amount by which the actual coefficient of variation exceeded the analytical uncertainty was a factor of two (100\%), but ranged from 15\% to 300\% depending on the nuclide and material. Coefficients of variation ranged from 3-4\% for 10Be to 6-8\% for 36Cl, 14C, and 21Ne, to 5-11\% for 26Al. Both interlaboratory bias and within-laboratory excess spread of the data played a role in increasing variability above the stated analytical uncertainties. The physical basis for cosmogenic nuclide production was investigated through numerical modeling and the measurement of energy-dependent neutron cross sections for nuclide interactions. We formulated new, physically based, scaling models, denoted LSD and LSDn, by generalizing global numerical simulations of cosmic-ray processes. The CRONUS-Earth Project identified new geological calibration sites, including one at low latitude and high elevation (Huancané, Peru), and replicated nuclide measurement at numerous laboratories. At many sites multiple nuclides were measured, providing much more confidence in the equivalence of surface-exposure ages calculated from differing nuclides. The data were interpreted using an original cosmogenic-nuclide calculator, CRONUScalc, that incorporates the new physically based scaling. The new data and model produced significantly better fits than previous efforts, but do not fully resolve apparent spatial variations in production rates. The CRONUS-Earth and CRONUS-EU Projects have provided a firm foundation for assessing the strengths and weaknesses of cosmogenic-nuclide analytical methods, adjusted the AMS standards for 10Be and consequently revised the half-life, and have provided improved calibration data sets and interpretative tools.},

	abstract = {A number of in situ cosmogenic radionuclides and stable nuclides have been measured in natural exposed rock surfaces with a view to study their in situ production and rock erosion rates [1]. The in situ radionuclides can be used for a high-resolution tomography of the erosional history of an exposed surface; two stable nuclides (3He, 21Ne) and five radionuclides (10Be, 26Al, 36Cl, 14C, 39Ar) having half-lives in the range of ∼ 300-1.5 × 106 yr half-life are measurable in many rock types. A prerequisite for the application of the in situ nuclides for the study of erosional histories of surfaces is a knowledge of their production rates under different irradiation conditions; altitude, latitude, irradiation geometry and shielding. Relative nuclide production rates can be determined fairly accurately using the extensive available data on cosmicray neutrons [2]. Absolute nuclide production rates cannot generally be predicted with any accuracy because of lack of data on excitation functions of nuclides unless some normalization is possible, as was done in the case of several cosmicray produced isotopes in the atmosphere [3]. Based on a recent natural calibration experiment in which erosion free surfaces exposed to cosmic radiation for ∼ 11,000 yrs were sampled, the absolute production rates of 10Be and 26Al in quartz have been accurately estimated for mountain altitudes in Sierra Nevada [4]. The absolute production rates of 10Be and 26Al in quartz can therefore be estimated fairly accurately for any given latitude and altitude. Some measurements of 14C in rocks of low erosion rate [5] similarly allow an estimate of its production rate. Attempts made to measure the in situ production rates of 3He in rocks have not yet led to a convergent production rate. In view of the importance of knowing the production rates of isotopes of He, Ne and Ar, I present here theoretical estimates of their production rates based on available cross-section data. I discuss the information that can be extracted from the study of the in situ nuclides in rocks. Useful parameters characterizing the exposure history of a rock surface are: (1) the effective surface exposure age; and (2) the time-averaged erosion rate. The implications of these parameters for single and multiple nuclide studies are discussed in terms of the erosion models considered.},

In order to accurately compare between results from different nuclides, a single method of calculation is necessary. Calculators exist in numerous forms with none matching the needs of the CRONUS-Earth project to provide a simple and consistent method to interpret data from most commonly used cosmogenic nuclides. A new program written for this purpose, CRONUScalc, is presented here. This unified code presents a method applicable to 10Be, 26Al, 36Cl, 3He, and 14C, with 21Ne in testing. The base code predicts the concentration of a sample at a particular depth for a particular time in the past, which can be used for many applications. The multi-purpose code already includes functions for performing production rate calibrations as well as calculating erosion rates and surface exposure ages for single samples and depth profiles. The code is available under the GNU General Public License agreement and can be downloaded and modified to deal with specific atypical scenarios.},

	abstract = {Cosmogenic nuclide concentrations in rocks and sediments are widely used to study the evolution of landscapes that have experienced complex exposure/burial and erosion histories. Measured nuclide concentrations are typically compared with those obtained by time-integrating hypothetical histories of erosion and exposure. The presence of erosion, in particular, complicates the time-integration of nuclide concentrations, because erosion removes nuclides while at the same time increasing their production in new material advected towards the surface. This relative movement between sample and surface calls for a choice between a Eulerian reference frame, in which the integration point is fixed relative to the surface, or a Lagrangian reference frame, in which the integration point rides the sample on its way to the surface. The equations developed in the early 1990s to compute changes in cosmogenic nuclide inventories for geological settings undergoing steady erosion are now used routinely, but they are not directly applicable for time-integrating nuclide concentrations related to variable exposure and erosional transience. In this study, we lay out the fundamental equations associated with the Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches to compute cosmogenic nuclide concentrations under the influence of variable exposure and erosion, and discuss the pros and cons of the two approaches for different scenarios. We then extend our analysis to unconsolidated sediment/soil profiles by outlining a new and flexible approach to modelling cosmogenic-nuclide depth profiles that include depth-dependent mixing processes, combined with variable erosion rates and complex exposure/burial histories. We conclude with a few guidelines for reporting the steps involved with computing cosmogenic nuclide concentrations in geological settings influenced by variable exposure and erosional transience.},

	abstract = {ERA-40 is a re-analysis of meteorological observations from September 1957 to August 2002 produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in collaboration with many institutions. The observing system changed considerably over this re-analysis period, with assimilable data provided by a succession of satellite-borne instruments from the 1970s onwards, supplemented by increasing numbers of observations from aircraft, ocean-buoys and other surface platforms, but with a declining number of radiosonde ascents since the late 1980s. The observations used in ERA-40 were accumulated from many sources. The first part of this paper describes the data acquisition and the principal changes in data type and coverage over the period. It also describes the data assimilation system used for ERA-40. This benefited from many of the changes introduced into operational forecasting since the mid-1990s, when the systems used for the 15-year ECMWF re-analysis (ERA-15) and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) re-analysis were implemented. Several of the improvements are discussed. General aspects of the production of the analyses are also summarized. A number of results indicative of the overall performance of the data assimilation system, and implicitly of the observing system, are presented and discussed. The comparison of background (short-range) forecasts and analyses with observations, the consistency of the global mass budget, the magnitude of differences between analysis and background fields and the accuracy of medium-range forecasts run from the ERA-40 analyses are illustrated. Several results demonstrate the marked improvement that was made to the observing system for the southern hemisphere in the 1970s, particularly towards the end of the decade. In contrast, the synoptic quality of the analysis for the northern hemisphere is sufficient to provide forecasts that remain skilful well into the medium range for all years. Two particular problems are also examined: excessive precipitation over tropical oceans and a too strong Brewer-Dobson circulation, both of which are pronounced in later years. Several other aspects of the quality of the re-analyses revealed by monitoring and validation studies are summarized. Expectations that the 'second-generation' ERA-40 re-analysis would provide products that are better than those from the first-generation ERA-15 and NCEP/NCAR re-analyses are found to have been met in most cases. © Royal Meteorological Society, 2005.},
